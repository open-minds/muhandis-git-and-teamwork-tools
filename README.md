# Teamwork & online Collaboration Tools
Presented by [Fortas Abdeldjalil](http://fcmam5.github.io/) (Open Mind Team member) for MC-Lab (Muhandis's C-Lab).
The workshop was about some of the best online collaboration tools, Git/Github, the power of open-source...

Taking a [NASA project](https://slack.com/customers/nasa), [Adobe Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) and a personal project as example.
How it was made ? How Brackets developers from everywhere work on the same project? How Slack helped NASA to keep it work clean and organized in one place? How I've worked with my university project team without having to be in the same room to code.

It was done only with some great tools, such as :
